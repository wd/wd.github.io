This my personal blog, to collect and write done some things I thought and learned. I'm trying to learn English now, so I wrote done these things in English, wish this can be make some help to improve my English.

WD is my name's first letters, it's also West Digital's shortname. This is very annoying, since lots of people find me to solve hard disk problems on twitter. SAD...

CC is my wife's nickname, which sounds cici, like her given name. I have suggested her to change CC to Cici, since there is no vowel letters in the name, people can't sounds it, but she didn't agree... oh, okay... I found my nickname is at the same situations, I thik I will not change it too ... :)

I am a software engineer for about twenty years, and write python, javascript, java now. I have used perl, lua, ruby and lots of other programing languages for what can make my work done. Programing languages are just tools, I'm not been fascinated by anyone of it.

I'm also a database administrator for PostgreSQL, which I think is the best database application now. So you maybe found some articles about postgreSQL or databases.

Ok, that's all. You can find me at [twitter](https://twitter.com/wd), [github](https://github.com/wd), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/wdicc).
