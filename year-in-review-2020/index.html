WFH is the new normal. Many thanks to my company, I was staying at home for most of last year.</p><div id=outline-container-headline-1 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-1>Family</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-1 class=outline-text-3><p>My daughter was born last year. Here name is Yoyo. Thanks for the WFH, that I could stay with her most of the time. Sometimes it was enjoyable to watch her grow up. Last winter, my wife and I have to go to the hospital to do regular checks every 2 or 3 days in the morning very early. It was tough for us. But anyway, Yoyo joins the family. She looks smart and adorable. I hope she will grow up soon. So we can travel over the world. I can't wait to through her into the clean water in the Maldives and see the smiling face from here.</p><p>My wife and I will be entering our 16 years marriage this year. I hope she and Yoyo will be happy every day, like what I said in the blog's subtitle.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-2 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-2>Works</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-3><p>Last year I left the BrilliantAero and joined Tubi, a small(?) company in the US. I worked in the Beijing office as SRE. It was a challenge for me that I need to learn lots of things, especially English. I think my English improved a lot during last year. I also learned a lot about AWS, Terraform, Ansible, and Infrastructure as Code.</p><p>We discuss topics on Github issues. I learned about how to review codes, how to cooperate with colleagues on Github. I'm immensely enjoying the time I work from home. No one will disturb you. You can work immersively.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-3>Readings</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-3><p>I begin to read some novels write for youth, so that I can persist in reading them.</p><p>Booklists:</p><ul><li>His Dark Materials: I finished the book before the last season of the TV show was released.</li><li>The healer</li><li>In the Middle of nowhere</li><li>东野圭吾：信</li><li>刺杀骑士团长</li><li>盗梦侦探 Paprika: I read this book after I watched the movie. The book has more details than the film. It's worth reading if you like the film.</li><li>以色列：一个国家的诞生</li><li>Kubernetes in Action: It's a great book to learn Kubernetes for beginners.</li></ul></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-4>English Study</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-3><p>I have lots of practice during my work now. I finished the Anki deck <a href=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1035811674>托福词汇-词以类记(词典完美版)</a> I started in 2019.</p><p>The quality of the deck for Anki is critical. After finished that deck, I haven't started a new deck yet. I think I will begin the deck for English Grammars. And I also begin to read a book about English Grammars. I found I almost forget what I have learned about Grammars in the colleges.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-5 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-5>TV</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-5 class=outline-text-3><p>I have watched a lots of TV shows, list some of them(also reccommand):</p><ul><li>Homeland</li><li>13 Reasons Why</li><li>Tales From The Loop</li><li>Lost in Space(2018)</li><li>Altered Carbon</li><li>The Expanse</li><li>Chilling Advanture of Sabrina</li><li>His Dark Meterials</li><li>Mandalorian</li><li>The Boys</li><li>Raised By Wolves</li><li>Westworld</li><li>The Witcher</li><li>The Umbrella Academy</li><li>kindom</li><li>Alice in Borderland</li><li>Dark</li><li>Queens Gambit</li><li>Devs</li><li>Chernobyl</li></ul></div></div></div><footer class=content__footer></footer></section><section class=page__aside><div class=aside__about><div class=aside__about><img class=about__logo src=https://wdicc.com/favicon.ico alt=Logo><h1 class=about__title>Happy every day!</h1><p class=about__description>Good good study, day day up!</p></div><ul class=aside__social-links><li><a href=https://github.com/wd rel=me aria-label=GitHub title=GitHub><i class="fa-brands fa-github" aria-hidden=true></i></a>&nbsp;</li></ul></div><hr><div class=aside__content><p>2021-01-04</p><hr>On this page:<nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#headline-1>Family</a></li><li><a href=#headline-2>Works</a></li><li><a href=#headline-3>Readings</a></li><li><a href=#headline-4>English Study</a></li><li><a href=#headline-5>TV</a></li></ul></nav></div></section><footer class=page__footer><p><br><span class=active>$ echo $LANG<br><b>zh_CN</b></span><br></p><br><br><p class=copyright>wd © 2025</p><p class=advertisement>Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io/>hugo</a> and <a href=https://github.com/joeroe/risotto>risotto</a>.</p></footer></div></body></html>
