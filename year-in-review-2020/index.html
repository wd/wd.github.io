2020 ends with the pandemic. WFH is the new normal. Many thanks to my company, I was staying at home for most of last year.


Family


My daughter was born last year. Here name is Yoyo. Thanks for the WFH, that I could stay with her most of the time. Sometimes it was enjoyable to watch her grow up. Last winter, my wife and I have to go to the hospital to do regular checks every 2 or 3 days in the morning very early. It was tough for us. But anyway, Yoyo joins the family. She looks smart and adorable. I hope she will grow up soon. So we can travel over the world. I can't wait to through her into the clean water in the Maldives and see the smiling face from here."><meta name=keywords content="2020,"><meta property="og:url" content="https://wdicc.com/year-in-review-2020/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="wd and cc"><meta property="og:title" content="Year in Review 2020"><meta property="og:description" content="2020 ends with the pandemic.

I worked in the Beijing office as SRE. It was a challenge for me that I need to learn lots of things, especially English. I think my English improved a lot during last year. I also learned a lot about AWS, Terraform, Ansible, and Infrastructure as Code.</p><p>We discuss topics on Github issues. I learned about how to review codes, how to cooperate with colleagues on Github. I'm immensely enjoying the time I work from home. No one will disturb you. You can work immersively.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-3>Readings</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-3><p>I begin to read some novels write for youth, so that I can persist in reading them.</p><p>Booklists:</p><ul><li>His Dark Materials: I finished the book before the last season of the TV show was released.</li><li>The healer</li><li>In the Middle of nowhere</li><li>东野圭吾：信</li><li>刺杀骑士团长</li><li>盗梦侦探 Paprika: I read this book after I watched the movie. The book has more details than the film. It's worth reading if you like the film.</li><li>以色列：一个国家的诞生</li><li>Kubernetes in Action: It's a great book to learn Kubernetes for beginners.</li></ul></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-4>English Study</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-3><p>I have lots of practice during my work now. I finished the Anki deck <a href=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1035811674>托福词汇-词以类记(词典完美版)</a> I started in 2019.</p><p>The quality of the deck for Anki is critical. After finished that deck, I haven't started a new deck yet. I think I will begin the deck for English Grammars. And I also begin to read a book about English Grammars. I found I almost forget what I have learned about Grammars in the colleges.</p></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-5 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-5>TV</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-5 class=outline-text-3><p>I have watched a lots of TV shows, list some of them(also reccommand):</p><ul><li>Homeland</li><li>13 Reasons Why</li><li>Tales From The Loop</li><li>Lost in Space(2018)</li><li>Altered Carbon</li><li>The Expanse</li><li>Chilling Advanture of Sabrina</li><li>His Dark Meterials</li><li>Mandalorian</li><li>The Boys</li><li>Raised By Wolves</li><li>Westworld</li><li>The Witcher</li><li>The Umbrella Academy</li><li>kindom</li><li>Alice in Borderland</li><li>Dark</li><li>Queens Gambit</li><li>Devs</li><li>Chernobyl</li></ul></div></div></content><div><div id=disqus_thread></div><script>window.disqus_config=function(){},function(){if(["localhost","127.0.0.1"].indexOf(window.location.hostname)!=-1){document.getElementById("disqus_thread").innerHTML="Disqus comments not available by default when the website is previewed locally.";return}var t=document,e=t.createElement("script");e.async=!0,e.src="//wdicc.disqus.com/embed.js",e.setAttribute("data-timestamp",+new Date),(t.head||t.body).appendChild(e)}()</script><noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href=https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript>comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript><a href=https://disqus.com class=dsq-brlink>comments powered by <span class=logo-disqus>Disqus</span></a></div></main><footer>Made with <a href=https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/>Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear</a></footer></body></html>
