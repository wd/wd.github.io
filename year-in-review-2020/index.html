2020 ends with the pandemic. WFH is the new normal. Many thanks to my company, I was staying at home for most of last year.</p>

Family
</h3>

<p>My daughter was born last year. Here name is Yoyo. Thanks for the WFH, that I could stay with her most of the time. Sometimes it was enjoyable to watch her grow up. Last winter, my wife and I have to go to the hospital to do regular checks every 2 or 3 days in the morning very early. It was tough for us. But anyway, Yoyo joins the family. She looks smart and adorable. I hope she will grow up soon. So we can travel over the world. I can't wait to through her into the clean water in the Maldives and see the smiling face from here.</p>
<p>
My wife and I will be entering our 16 years marriage this year. I hope she and Yoyo will be happy every day, like what I said in the blog's subtitle.</p>

Works
</h3>
<div id=outline-text-headline-2 class=outline-text-3>
<p>Last year I left the BrilliantAero and joined Tubi, a small(?) company in the US. I worked in the Beijing office as SRE. It was a challenge for me that I need to learn lots of things, especially English. I think my English improved a lot during last year. I also learned a lot about AWS, Terraform, Ansible, and Infrastructure as Code.</p>
<p>
We discuss topics on Github issues. I learned about how to review codes, how to cooperate with colleagues on Github. I'm immensely enjoying the time I work from home. No one will disturb you. You can work immersively.</p>

Readings
</h3>
<div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-3>
<p>I begin to read some novels write for youth, so that I can persist in reading them.</p>
<p>
Booklists:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>His Dark Materials: I finished the book before the last season of the TV show was released.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The healer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Middle of nowhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>东野圭吾：信</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>刺杀骑士团长</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>盗梦侦探 Paprika: I read this book after I watched the movie. The book has more details than the film. It's worth reading if you like the film.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>以色列：一个国家的诞生</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kubernetes in Action: It's a great book to learn Kubernetes for beginners.</p>
</li>
</ul>

English Study
</h3>
<div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-3>
<p>I have lots of practice during my work now. I finished the Anki deck <a href=https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1035811674>托福词汇-词以类记(词典完美版)</a> I started in 2019.</p>
<p>
The quality of the deck for Anki is critical. After finished that deck, I haven't started a new deck yet. I think I will begin the deck for English Grammars. And I also begin to read a book about English Grammars. I found I almost forget what I have learned about Grammars in the colleges.</p>
