&lt;p>My daughter was born last year. Here name is Yoyo. Thanks for the WFH, that I could stay with her most of the time. Sometimes it was enjoyable to watch her grow up. Last winter, my wife and I have to go to the hospital to do regular checks every 2 or 3 days in the morning very early. It was tough for us. But anyway, Yoyo joins the family. She looks smart and adorable. I hope she will grow up soon. So we can travel over the world. I can&amp;#39;t wait to through her into the clean water in the Maldives and see the smiling face from here.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
