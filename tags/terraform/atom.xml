I was using AWS before I join the current company, but I don&amp;#39;t even know terraform before I interview with the current company. I got hit by Terraform at first, it&amp;#39;s really hard to deal with states.&lt;/p>

Use &lt;code class="verbatim">-target&lt;/code> with &lt;code class="verbatim">plan&lt;/code> command to collaborate
&lt;/h3>

When you work with your colleagues with same terraform project, sometimes they maybe need to apply some changes that haven&amp;#39;t merged yet for testing, when you run the plan command, you will find that terraform want to destroy his resources. You can wait until his changes have merged. But actually, you can use the &lt;code class="verbatim">-target&lt;/code> to limit your resources for the plan command. So, you can run the plan command happily without destroying other people&amp;#39;s resources.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
