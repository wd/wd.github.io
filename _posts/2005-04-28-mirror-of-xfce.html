Mirroring 
If you want to use our Debian packages on multiple systems in a networked environment, it might be a good idea to establish a local mirror of our Debian repository, so you don&#39;t need to fetch the packages from the internet for every system. You can use the utility debmirror to create a mirror of the packages and keep it up to date. 

For example, to mirror the i386 binary packages into the directory /ftp/mirror/debian, use the command: 


debmirror -a i386 -s main -h www.os-works.com \
          -d testing -r /debian --progress \
          -e http --ignore-release-gpg \
          /ftp/mirror/debian

Say, for example, the directory /ftp/mirror/debian is accessible via ftp as ftp://mymirror/debian/, then you&#39;d put the line 


deb ftp://mymirror/debian/ testing main

in the /etc/apt/sources.list file on every system in your network.
